<h2 class="offer-title">Energy Performance Certificate (EPC)</h2>
<p>An Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) is mandatory in your home whether you are buying, renting or selling your property or merely installing a Solar PV System. An EPC check guides you on making your home energy efficient thereby reducing carbon dioxide emissions. With the help of an EPC check you will get to know exactly what the efficiency rating is and what the CO2 emissions of the building are. With the help of an EPC Check advice is provided as to how you can reduce cost savings to your home through future energy efficiency methods. An EPC has a ten year validity. A requirement for Solar PV Installations since 1st April 2012.</p>
<br>
<h2>As part of our service:</h2>
<ul class="key-feature-list nav nav-pills">
<li>Our Domestic Energy Assessors are qualified to inspect any property to assess it for efficiency, to issue certificates and to advise on any improvements — such as fitting loft insulation, double glazing or boiler replacement. As you can see from an Energy Efficiency Rating chart, grades are awarded ranging from ‘A’ at the top for very-energy-efficient, down to ‘G’ for the least energy-efficient home, with the average grade being a 'D'.</li>
<li>Once we’ve carried out the survey and issued the energy performance certificate, it will be lodged in a central database along with a unique identifying number. Access to each EPC held on the database is restricted to the property owner / seller and potential buyers via this unique reference number.</li>
</ul>

<h1 class="offer-title">All You need to know about Gas Safety Certificate</h1>
<p>
Owning a property and running a successful rental property business can demand a lot of
hard work and energy, especially if you own multiple properties. As much as it is a business
with scope and profit, there are certain responsibilities that involve expenses to maintain a
well functional property that remains comfortable and safe for the tenants. It is solely the
responsibility of the landlord to maintain the gas appliances in their property and keep them
on check and make sure they are safe to use. Hence, it is the landlords responsibility to
invest on getting a gas safety certificate.
</p>
<h1 class="offer-title">Why do Landlords need a Gas Safety Certificate?</h1>
<p>  
Gas Safety certification (CP12) is important to ensure the safety of your tenants and that is
the only way to show that your gas appliances such as gas boilers, gas hobs and gas fires
are intact. This checkup has to happen regularly on an annual basis since the certificate is
valid only for 12 months. It should also be carried out by Gas Safe registered engineers who
are certified professionals. We at Home Solutions London have registered engineers who
would help you get your appliances inspected and lead you through until getting the
certification.</p>
<p>
Read further to understand cost, procedure and other questions answered on Landlord
safety certification.</p>

<h2 class="offer-title">Gas Safety Inspection and Certifying Procedure</h2>
<p>
As a landlord when you get this service you need to be aware of the various different steps
an engineer would carry out before issuing you a certificate.
</p>
<p>
1. The team would initially do a visual inspection on the installation and locations of all
the gas appliances, fireplaces and chimneys. They would check for any signs of
unfinished combustion.</p>
<br>
<p>
Then they would check for the following aspects:</p>
<p>
2. The casings, ignition chambers and closures of gas boilers.<br>
3. The precise labelling and condition of the gas meter and valves meant for emergency
control.<br>
4. If the ventilation passages are not blocked and are in fully working order<br>
5. The safety devices are operating efficiently<br>
6. The appliance is burning at the correct operating pressure<br>
7. Harmful gases are transferring cleanly outside of the home
</p>
<p>The entire process would take up to 45 minutes to an hour. However if any immediate gas
boiler repairs were noted to be carried out, it might take a little longer. It sure is advisable for
the landlord or the tenants to be present during the inspection for you are also aware of how
the procedure is carried out and how important it is for you to perhaps be informed on things
such as these that you don&#39;t quite often think a lot about. Your presence may also help the
team locate the gas boilers, and terminals making things happen faster.</p>

<h2 class="offer-title">Cost of getting Gas Safety Certificate</h2>

<p>The cost is perhaps one of the primary questions that arise for a landlord when getting a gas
safety certificate. The market has many companies offering this service but there sure are
aspects you would need to make sure before choosing your ideal service.</p>

<p>
1. Look for whether the personnels involved in inspection and certifying are gas safe
certified engineers. We, at Home Solutions London, have only certified professionals
who would show the printed ID card with their registration details for your verification.<br>
2. Look for if they offer any discounts on getting multiple gas boilers (appliances)
certified within the same property. Home Solutions London offers an attractive
discount and you can contact us for further information.<br>
3. Look for the any hidden fees involved. Some companies may have additional costs
that may not be transparent when signing up. At home solution a guaranteed amount
with no additional fees is quoted after an engineer visits your property and looks for
what needs to be looked in to in case of repairs and so on. A written estimate is then
given to you.
</p>


<h2 class="offer-title">What happens if you have multiple gas appliances?</h2>

<p>It is important to be informed that in case you need multiple boilers to be certified, there
could be additional charges incurred. You would be looking at paying approximately 30%
extra for every additional appliance within the same property.
We have discussed the importance, cost involved and procedure of getting a Gas safety
certificate in this article. Apart from these, if there may be anything at all that you would need
to know you can contact us any time. Our services are not just limited to Gas Safety
certifying; it is many more under the umbrella of home solutions.</p>
