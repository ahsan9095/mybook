<h2 class="section-title">Boiler Service London - Why is it important?</h2>
<p>A regular boiler servicing is more important than you think! Here is why it is so:</p>
<p>- It helps you prevent any major damages that would lead to a complete replacement
in the long run.<br>
- It could help you detect small problems and avoid them from potentially causing
further damage to the heating system within the appliances.<br>
- It would definitely prevent you from facing emergency boiler repair situations where
you will have to suffer due to a sudden boiler breakdown and may need to call us in
the middle of the night.<br>
- It would be cheaper to have them maintained regularly so that you will not have to
spend more in repairing or replacement<br>
- It helps you reduce heating costs because our engineers would try to improve the
overall efficiency of the appliance preventing it from using excessive energy<br>
- Having a safe environment within the house is extremely important and carbon
monoxide (the silent killer) emissions from faulty boilers can be kept at bay by regular
servicing<br>
- Regular servicing is often tied to warranty and therefore, it helps in keeping your
warranty intact by servicing your boilers<br>
-Boilers and other heating appliances are valuable and just like any other home
appliance, a regular check-up is crucial for it to be running smoothly</p>
<p>We have engineers experienced in working with all makes and models of boilers. Like
advised by all leading boiler manufacturers, an annual boiler service would mean nothing but
a trouble free, safe and an active warranty for the appliance.</p>

<h3 class="offer-title">Boiler Service London - Conventional Boilers Vs Combination Boilers</h3>
<p>Conventional boilers are typically made of two tanks one within the loft, filling in cold water
and the other holding heated water which is then supplied to different taps within the house.
Conventional boilers are usually referred to as heat only boilers and provide hot water only
and not contribute to the central heating system. Combination boilers on the other hand, do
not have tanks that fill in cold water and then heat it, but it directly heats up the water as you
open the hot water tap. As a single unit, they are used for water heating as well as space
heating.</p>
<p class="highlight-texts">Usually a combination boiler is preferred over a conventional boiler for the following reasons:</p>
<ul class="key-feature-list2">
<li><h6>It holds up less space than a conventional boiler with large tanks</h6></li>
<li><h6>Water consumption is minimised since water is heated only when needed</h6></li>
<li><h6>Both hot and cold water would flow at the same speed</h6></li>
<li><h6>Water is heated up through the mains</h6></li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, conventional boilers are perhaps the best option for some home settings
depending on the setup of the house. Here are some benefits of getting a conventional
boiler:</p>
<ul class="key-feature-list2">
<li><h6>Flow rates are faster than combi boilers and even if multiple taps are in use within
the same time the speed is not compromised</h6></li>
<li><h6>Uses a backup electrical hot water heating system through immersions</h6></li>
<li><h6>They are solar power compatible</h6></li>
</ul>
