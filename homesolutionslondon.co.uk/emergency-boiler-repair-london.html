any of these, ring us right away!	
</p>
<h2 class="section-title">Common issues caused to boilers that require immediate attention</h2>

<p>1. Dripping of Pipes and Leaking - These are identified by broken pipes or valves and
could be detected and fixed only by professionals.</p>
<p>2. No Hot Water or Heat - You will easily know when this occurs, but the reasons could
be due to low water levels or even a broken diaphragm. A qualified heating engineer
should attend to it to identify and replace any faulty parts.</p>
<p>3. Unusual Noises from the Boiler  - You may hear gurgling or bubbling sounds from
your boiler and that may not be a serious issue. However, getting them checked will
help further damage to the internal parts of your boiler such as the heat exchanger.</p>
<p>4. The Pilot Light doesn&#39;t switch on - This may be due to minor causes such as
clogged up residue at the pilot light preventing it from lighting.
5. Thermostat issues - An issue with the thermostat can be detected by it turning on or
off on it own in the wrong times. A thermostat replacement can fix the problem.</p>
<p>6. Pressure loss - A faulty pressure release valve or a water leak could cause this
issue.</p>
<p>7. Boiler turns itself off - This could be quite annoying because you may have to
manually switch it on constantly and it would turn off on its own probably due to a
number of reasons namely, pump issue, thermostat failure, poor water circulation
and so on. Only an experienced engineer would be able to diagnose the issue and
give you a solution.</p>
